# TAMED
Tamed is a cutting-edge solution for investors, asset managers, and risk managers who are looking to make more informed investment decisions. By using advanced AI and natural language processing techniques, our tool can analyze large amounts of unstructured data, such as company reports, news articles, and social media, to provide accurate and comprehensive information about a company's environmental, social, and governance performance. This allows investors to identify companies that are making genuine efforts to improve their ESG performance and avoid those that are engaging in greenwashing. But we don't stop there, our AI-powered recommendation engine takes it a step further by providing insights and actionable recommendations for investment decisions. This can drastically improve decision-making for those who are looking to align their investments with their values and make a positive impact on society. The AI-powered recommendation engine has the power to analyze a vast amount of data and identify patterns that may be missed by human analysis. It can also provide a more unbiased and objective analysis, as it is not subject to human emotions and cognitive biases. The tool also provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to access and interact with the data and insights, making it easy to use for both novice and experienced investors
